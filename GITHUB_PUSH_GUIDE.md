## 🔐 Authentication Setup

You'll need to set up GitHub authentication to push the code. Choose one of these methods:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Set expiration and select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
   - Copy the generated token

2. **Configure Git credentials:**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Push with token:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/black12-ag/munir-demo-chat.git
   git push -u origin main
   # When prompted, use your GitHub username and the token as password
   ```

### Option 2: SSH Key (Alternative)

1. **Check for existing SSH key:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ssh
   ```

2. **Generate new SSH key if needed:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   - Copy public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste the key and save

4. **Test connection and push:**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:black12-ag/munir-demo-chat.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Push Commands

Once authentication is set up, run these commands in the project directory:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/munir011/Desktop/StitchChatApp

# Verify everything is ready
git status

# Push to GitHub (the commit is already prepared)
git push -u origin main
```
